# Welcome to the Game Tic-tac-toe-2020

I wrote this "Tic-tac-toe" game in 2020 when I was learning about programming. This project was written in Pascal. The game has three levels of difficulty, and a system for counting wins.

Application loading screen, it is fully interactive.

The game has a choice of difficulty levels:
* Easy - There is a high probability that the opponent will not see the correct move
* Normal - Stronger opponent, but sometimes wrong
* Hard - Hard to beat, almost never wrong

## Game process
> **Note**: The game has a counter of victories, according to the results of the matches played.

The game starts with your turn. In the right part of the playing area, the correspondence of the cells to the numbers is shown.
For the user's move, you need to specify the cell number, the user always plays for **O**.
